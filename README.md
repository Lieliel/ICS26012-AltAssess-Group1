# Schedulyzer

Schedulyzer is a comprehensive tool designed to simulate and analyze various scheduling algorithms. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for users to interact with the system and understand the working of different scheduling algorithms.

## Features

- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: Simulates the non-preemptive SJF CPU scheduling algorithm. Users can input the number of processes along with their arrival and burst times, and the program will calculate the waiting and turnaround times for each process, as well as the average waiting and turnaround times.

- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**: Simulates the preemptive SRTF CPU scheduling algorithm. Like SJF, users can input the number of processes along with their arrival and burst times, and the program will calculate the waiting and turnaround times for each process, as well as the average waiting and turnaround times.

- **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**: Simulates the SSTF disk scheduling algorithm. Users can input the current position, track size, seek rate, and number of requests, and the program will calculate the total head movement and seek time.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly GUI makes it easy to choose a scheduling algorithm, input the necessary parameters, and view the results.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Choose a scheduling algorithm (SJF, SRTF, or SSTF).
3. Input the necessary parameters.
4. View the results.
5. Choose to repeat the process or terminate the program.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Run the Main class.
